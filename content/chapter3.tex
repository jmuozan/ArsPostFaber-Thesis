The theoretical framework developed in the previous chapters suggested that genuine democratization of digital fabrication requires preservation-based approaches that maintain adaptive authority rather than simply expanding access to predetermined tools. Yet this analysis raised questions about implementation: \textit{How might such preservation actually operate within existing technological contexts?} \textit{Could alternative "interfaces" bridge the gap between computational precision and embodied expression?} The following interventions sought to address these questions through practical experiments that tested the theoretical propositions in real-world making contexts.

This chapter will document different "interventions" that progressively refined approaches to preserving the embodied knowledge within digital workflows. Each experiment built upon insights from the previous, leading to the development of Ars Post Faber, the open-source Grasshopper\footnote{Grasshopper is a visual programming language and environment that runs within the Rhinoceros 3D computer CAD software. Developed by David Rutten at Robert McNeel \& Associates, Grasshopper enables users to build generative algorithms through a node-based interface without requiring traditional programming knowledge, making it widely used in parametric design, digital fabrication, and computational design workflows.} plugin\footnote{A plugin (also called an add-on or extension) is a software component that adds specific functionality to an existing program. In the context of CAD and design software, plugins extend the applications capabilities by providing new tools, commands, or workflows. They are typically developed by third parties and can be installed and removed without modifying the main software, allowing users to customize their design environment for specific tasks or methodologies.} that embodies the research's theoretical conclusions.

\section{\textit{CR3ATED}: Reimagining CAD Interfaces for Artisan Expression}
\textit{"If craftsmanship's essence lies in the creative problem solving process, how can digital fabrication tools become active participants in it rather than automation devices?"}

\subsection{Exploring Alternative Interface Approaches}

Building upon insights from AI.RTISANSHIP, it was concluded that computational systems could successfully capture and analyze certain patterns of skilled movement, yet this technical capability highlighted a bigger challenge where the preserved data represented only "surface" manifestations of embodied knowledge rather than the adaptive reasoning processes. This raised a different question: \textit{Rather than attempting to extract embodied knowledge from practitioners, what if digital tools could be designed to better support and amplify the adaptive decision-making processes that characterize skilled practice?}

\vspace{0.5cm}

This inquiry led to the development of \textit{CR3ATED}, a web-based application designed to test alternative interface approaches within digital design and fabrication workflows. Where AI.RTISANSHIP looked to decode existing craft knowledge through computational analysis, \textit{CR3ATED} explored how interface design itself might preserve creative expression by exploring different human-software interactions.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The \textit{CR3ATED} experiment investigated whether alternative modes of human-software interaction could maintain the continuity between creative intention and material execution that conventional CAD workflows tend to fragment. The central hypothesis was that interface design actively constructs the kinds of creative relationships that become possible within digital fabrication workflows, suggesting that preserving craft agency might require different approaches to how makers engage with computational design tools.

\subsection{Craftinnova: Testing Alternative Interfaces}

The CR3ATED web application was developed specifically for the "Nuevos MÃ©todos de Aprendizaje Artesano" workshop at CRAFTINNOVA\footnote{CRAFTINNOVA is Spain's national event combining artistic crafts and innovation, held annually in Valladolid. The event brings together creators, designers, manufacturers, technology experts, digital fabrication professionals, artists, entrepreneurs, and makers to explore the intersection of traditional craftsmanship with digital technologies.}, creating an opportunity to test these alternative interface approaches with practicing artisans in a real-world context. The workshop brought together traditional craftspeople with clay 3D printing technology, creating an ideal laboratory for investigating how interface design affects the preservation of creative expression.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Rather than using conventional CAD software, the webapp, implemented a touch-based sketching interface that allowed participants to create 3D models through direct manipulation on mobile devices. The application translated 2D sketches into revolution surfaces suitable for clay printing, maintaining the intuitive hand-to-head connection that characterizes crafts while engaging with the digital fabrication capabilities of the machine.

\vspace{0.5cm}

This approach acknowledged that conventional CAD systems fail to express the imperfection and responsiveness from the craft practice. By creating a workflow that began with tactile sketching and culminated with material engagement, the experiment explored how technology might contribute to craft preservation by becoming integrated into evolving creative practice rather than replacing traditional methods.
