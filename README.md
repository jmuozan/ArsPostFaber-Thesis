\textit{The craftsperson's relationship with their tools shapes not only what they make, but how they think about making itself.}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The theoretical framework developed in the previous chapters culminates in a practical question: \textit{How might digital design tools be restructured to preserve the continuous dialogue between maker, material, and machine that characterizes unified agency?} This chapter documents the development of \textit{Ars Post Faber}, an open-source Grasshopper plugin that attempts to bridge the gap between the conception-execution separation identified in contemporary CAD/CAM workflows.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Drawing from the experimental insights gathered through \textit{CR3ATED}, \textit{AI Tools}, and the \textit{Component that Makes}, \textit{Ars Post Faber} represents an integrated approach to preserving embodied knowledge within digital fabrication contexts. Rather than simplifying tools to increase accessibility or automating processes to eliminate complexity, the plugin introduces new forms of interaction that maintain computational capabilities while enabling the adaptive authority of the user.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The name \textit{Ars Post Faber} deliberately references both craft traditions and contemporary technological possibilities. \textit{Ars}, from the Latin meaning skill or craft, acknowledges the continuity with traditional making practices that this research seeks to preserve. \textit{Post Faber}, meaning "after the maker," suggests not the elimination of human creative agency but its transformation within digitally-mediated contexts. This represents neither a nostalgic return to pre-industrial craft nor a wholesale embrace of automated production, but how contemporary computational capabilities might support rather than replace the adaptive decision-making that enables skilled making.

\section{From Theory to Implementation}

The development of \textit{Ars Post Faber} required translating the theoretical insights about unified agency, preservation-based democratization, and adaptive authority into specific design principles that could guide software implementation. This translation process challenged the maintainance of theoretical coherence while addressing the practical constraints and opportunities present within existing CAD environments.

\subsection{Preserving Process Over Product}

Traditional CAD workflows prioritize the efficient production of geometric specifications suitable for manufacturing, treating the design process itself as expendable scaffolding that can be discarded once final specifications are determined. This product-centered approach aligns with the distributed agency model that concentrates creative authority within separate design phases while rendering material execution increasingly automated and non-responsive.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textit{Ars Post Faber} inverts this priority by treating the creative process as equally important to the final geometric outcome. Rather than optimizing for efficient specification delivery, the plugin preserves the complete narrative of design development, including iterations, modifications, decision points, and even errors that contributed to the final result. This process preservation enables future makers to understand not just what was created, but how and why creative decisions emerged through the making dialogue.

\vspace{0.5cm}

By maintaining the complete creative narrative, \textit{Ars Post Faber} enables what might be termed \textit{generative reproduction}, where future implementations or attempts to replicate can build upon previous work while adapting to new contexts.

\subsection{Open Source Foundation and Community Authority}

\textit{Ars Post Faber} is released under the MIT License, representing a commitment to genuine democratization through community control over the technological development of the projects instead of concentrating it within proprietary systems. The MIT License text explicitly defines the parameters of this collaborative approach:

\end{verbatim}

This licensing framework empowers makers to build upon each other's work in ways that create new expressions of creative agency. Unlike proprietary systems that require users to adapt their practices to predetermined software logic, the open source model enables the software itself to evolve in response to diverse making practices and cultural contexts. Makers can fork the codebase to develop specialized versions for particular fabrication techniques, contribute improvements that benefit the broader community, or integrate components into entirely new workflows that reflect their unique creative approaches.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The collaborative development model inherent in open source software mirrors the guild-like knowledge sharing that characterized pre-industrial craft communities. However, rather than being constrained by geographic proximity or trade boundaries, digital collaboration enables global communities of makers to collectively develop fabrication tools that preserve and extend traditional craft knowledge while leveraging on contemporary computational capabilities. This represents a form of \textit{distributed intelligence}, where individual makers contribute specialized knowledge that enhances the collective capacity for creative expression.

\subsection{Plugin Architecture and Computational Transparency}

The plugin architecture operates through computational augmentation rather than automation. Each component works as a mediator expanding human creative capabilities while preserving decision-making authority throughout the fabrication process. The goal is to find newer ways to express through CAD no matter how unoptimal or unefficient they are.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Integration with Grasshopper leverages the platform's node-based visual programming environment to maintain transparency in computational processes. Unlike black-box systems that hide their operational logic, Grasshopper's visual programming approach enables makers to understand, modify, and extend the computational relationships that connect design intentions with fabrication outcomes.
